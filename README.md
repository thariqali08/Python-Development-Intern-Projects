# Task 1 - ATM Machine Simulation
This project is a simulation of an ATM machine using the Tkinter library in Python. The graphical user interface (GUI) allows users to perform basic banking operations such as balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, cash deposit, PIN change, and viewing transaction history. The project emphasizes security by requiring PIN verification for all transactions and provides immediate feedback to the user through pop-up dialogs.

## Features

- **Balance Inquiry**: Check your current account balance after entering the correct PIN.
- **Cash Withdrawal**: Withdraw cash from your account, provided you have sufficient balance.
- **Cash Deposit**: Deposit cash into your account and increase your balance.
- **Change PIN**: Update your ATM PIN securely by verifying the current PIN.
- **Transaction History**: View a list of all transactions, including deposits and withdrawals.
- **Exit**: Safely close the ATM simulation.
